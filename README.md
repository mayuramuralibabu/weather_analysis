 ### Preprocessing - 
  Outlier detection,
  Missing Value imputation, 
  Data Sampling.
 ### Data Visualzation -
   Plot analysis on important features, 
   Correlation Analysis.
   Normalization - Standard and MinMax scaling
   Model Selection - Polynomial transformations
 ### Model Training - Regression Analysis
    Using a bar gaph we can pin our predictions and orignal values side by side and determine most if not all predicted values. 
    Were close to actual accurate prediction of tmax records.
